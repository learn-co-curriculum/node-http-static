## Introduction

Every webpage on the Internet is served by some HTTP web server. For this simple reasons, building web servers is an important skill to have. Single-page applications and static web pages (static files) which don't require server-side logic, can be served by static HTTP web servers like Apache, or Nginx.

In this lab, you'll build a static file server to serve static files over the HTTP protocol.
